## Mechanisms

### Module

Classes derived from `Module` require to declare their input dependencies (`requirements`) and output fields
(`provisions`) by registering named fields through a global FieldManager. At runtime, FieldManager assigns a
unique ID and size to each field, and maintains a registry of source factories. Then the modules sequentially
produce or process data segments identified by FieldId.

### NeuroPolicy

`NeuroPolicy` orchestrates a set of `Module` instances into a neural‐network policy pipeline. It:

1. Loads YAML configuration, reads user‐specified modules and adds a configured `Actuator`.
2. Ensures the `action` field has a source, then resolves dependencies by creating modules from unresolved requirements.
3. Resolves execution order from declared `requirements`/`provisions`, and reports circular or duplicate providers.
4. On `reset()`, calls `reset()` on each resolved module.
5. In each `act()` step, sequentially invokes `update()`, takes `action` from the field map, and sends it to the
   robot through the `Actuator`.
6. After `act()` returns and the low-level command is handed off, runs a post-act phase for module state latching
   and slower work such as publishing configured fields.
